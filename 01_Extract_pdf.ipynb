      "teams, increasing scalability and independence. Finally, Data Fabric unifies access across diverse storage \n",
      "tiers, emphasizing ubiquity and agility. These distinct attributes make each data architecture suitable for \n",
      "different needs and industry contexts. \n",
      "Implementing Data Mesh and Data Fabric in Existing Data Lake Architecture \n",
      "Data Mesh and Data Fabric can be integrated into existing data lake architectures to enhance \n",
      "scalability and facilitate data accessibility. In a data mesh architecture, the existing data lake could be \n",
      "treated as one of the multiple domain-oriented data products. The core idea would be distributing data \n",
      "responsibility among several cross-functional teams, improving agility and responsiveness1. \n",
      "A data fabric can act as a holistic layer over the existing data lake, providing unified data access \n",
      "and processing across all data sources. A data fabric can help to resolve data silos within the data lake \n",
      "and provide a more streamlined and efficient way to manage and access data2. \n",
      "Implementing Data Mesh or Data Fabric within an existing data lake infrastructure could \n",
      "significantly enhance the organization's data management capabilities. However, it requires thoughtful \n",
      "planning, a robust data governance model, and, potentially, significant organizational changes. \n",
      "Data Mesh is a new architectural concept that aims to address the limitations of centralized and \n",
      "monolithic data platforms. In a Data Mesh paradigm, data is treated as a product and is managed by \n",
      "cross-functional teams, each responsible for a specific domain's data. This domain-oriented, \n",
      "decentralized approach addresses scalability issues and reduces the complexity associated with large-\n",
      "scale data platforms. \n",
      "On the other hand, Data Fabric is an architecture and set of data services that provide \n",
      "consistent capabilities across a range of endpoints spanning on-premises and multiple cloud \n",
      "environments. The main goal is to provide an integrated layer (the \"fabric\") that helps companies \n",

      "data architectures have been proposed since the start of enterprise data solutions in the \n",
      "1970s, a lot of companies still struggle to find suitable solutions for their specific problems \n",
      "and to overcome challenges like the need for a growing number of increasingly specialized \n",
      "data engineers and a growing burden of dependencies. \n",
      "In an attempt to solve these common architecture failure modes, Zhamak Dehghani \n",
      "presented the data mesh [De19], a data architecture that is not focused on the centralized \n",
      "monolithic data architecture but instead provides a more distributed, democratized \n",
      "approach. Supported by a self-serve tooling and data platform, the business is separated \n",
      "into independent, empowered domains, which create autonomous data products that are \n",
      "shared in a company-wide data marketplace. While the data mesh has started a big \n",

      "four main concepts: Domain Ownership, Data as a Product, Self-Serve Infrastructure \n",
      "Platform, and Federated Governance. According to Domain Ownership, a company \n",

      "distributing the company into independent data domains with a federated governance, the \n",

      "a centralized infrastructure team would manage data ownership across domains; however, the product thinking focus of \n",
      "a data mesh model distributes this ownership to the producers, who are the subject matter experts (SMEs). Their \n",

      " \n",
      "While this domain-driven approach makes data producers accountable for articulating semantic definitions, cataloging \n",

      "standards and procedures. Furthermore, while domain teams are accountable for their ETL or ELT data pipelines in a data \n",

      "they react to change, and the constant change of the data landscape. Table 1 demonstrates some of the key differences \n",
      "between traditional data warehouse and data mesh architectural design. There are direct benefits for an organization \n",
      "adopting this data mesh design concept, and those are highlighted below. \n",
      " \n",
      "A. Agility and scalability \n",
      " \n",
      "Because of the decentralized data infrastructure as a service, there is a considerable improvement in time-to-market, \n",
      "scalability, and overall business domain agility, as well as a reduction in the IT backlog. This is also due to the agile \n",

      "B.  Strong central governance to control end-to-end compliance. \n",

      "following global data governance principles enhances data quality and accessibility [8]. There will be no more data dumps \n",

      "In contrast to traditional data architecture approaches that encourage the isolation of skill teams, which frequently have \n",
      "large backlogs, Data Mesh presents a solution in which domain experts and owners are in charge. This is carried out \n",
      "through enhanced domain expertise, tighter collaboration between business and IT departments, and agile virtual teams \n",

      "the competition [9]. The International Data Corporation (IDC) forecasts the amount of data to more than double in the\n",
      "years 2022 - 2026 with private organizations leading the growth [26]. However, current centralized data architectures\n",
      "fail to keep up with the scale and scope of data and analytics use cases [6, 7, 18]. As recent empirical insights show,\n",
      "architectures that rely on centralized data warehouses and data lakes have the major drawback that the logical flow\n",
      "of data does not follow the organization’s structure [14]. This is problematic as the production and consumption\n",
      "of analytical data is increasingly decentralized [31]. The mismatch between production and consumption results in\n",
      "bottlenecks at the central IT department, unclear responsibilities, and data silos throughout the organization [7].\n",
      "Consequently, organizations fail to leverage data for business decisions and the development of products and services.\n",
      "Dehghani [7] postulates data mesh as a new socio-technical data concept to tackle the shortcomings of centralized,\n",
      "monolithic, and domain-agnostic data management approaches which are common today. Data mesh is a socio-technical\n",
      "concept based on four main principles: domain-oriented decentralized data ownership, data as a product, self-serve\n",
      "data platform, and federated computational governance. Collectively the main principles enable data democratization.\n",

      "FOUNDATIONS AND RELATED WORK\n",
      "Organizations have to continuously re-think and adopt their data strategies, architectures, and management systems\n",
      "to create value from an ever-increasing amount of data to stay competitive in the field [27]. In the past, various\n",
      "terminologies have emerged around the related concepts, including but not limited to terms such as “data warehouse”,\n",
      "“data lake”, and, more recently “data lakehouse”, “data mesh”, and “data fabric”. In this foundational section, we try to\n",
      "shed light on these terms, the underlying concepts, and their relationship.\n",
      "In general, data warehouses and data lakes focus on data management, while data lakehouses, data mesh, and data\n",
      "fabric broadly refer to data architectures. Data management systems and architectures differ in the level of abstraction.\n",
      "For instance, a data architecture may include and orchestrate multiple data management systems.\n",
      "Data warehouses are specific databases that include structured data from multiple sources and mainly serve as central\n",
      "storage for processed data [30]. They traditionally store data for business intelligence and reporting purposes and thus\n",
      "refrain from the storage of data for future exploration [19]. In comparison, data lakes are able to ingest data at greater\n",
      "speeds and store higher volumes, as well as different types of data [20]. In contrast to data warehouses, data lakes\n",
      "additionally store raw data for future exploration and possible business activities. As such, they are of great importance\n",
      "for machine learning (ML) applications. The recently emerged architectural concept called data lakehouse combines the\n",
      "benefits of both, data lake and data warehouse. In accordance with related literature, we summarize and define the\n",
      "three terms as follows:\n",
      "Definition 1: Data warehouse. Data warehousing is a database structure for assembling and managing data from\n",
      "various sources for the purpose of gaining a single, detailed view of business activities [10].\n",
      "Definition 2: Data lake. A data lake is a logical view of all data sources, in their raw format, available and accessible\n",
      "by data scientists to find new insights [19].\n",
      "Definition 3: Data lakehouse. Data lakehouse is a data architecture concept that combines the low-cost storage (of\n",
      "structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data) of data lakes, with the benefits of a data warehouse like fast query\n",
      "performance and effective data governance [22, based on].\n",
      "Data Mesh: Motivational Factors, Challenges, and Best Practices\n",
      "3\n",
      "In contrast, data mesh is a socio-technical concept, including architectural aspects. Its goal is the successful and\n",
      "efficient establishment of data products. Dehghani [7] argues that data mesh consists of four main principles that\n",
      "allow organizations to manage data at scale. First, domain-oriented decentralized data ownership: individual domains\n",
      "own the data they produce and leverage their domain knowledge to improve data quality. We define domains as\n",
      "organization-specific delineations of the relevant competitive boundaries of the organizations [28]. For instance, the\n",
      "production department acts as a domain that owns all production-related data as they have the greatest expertise and\n",
      "are able to understand complex technical relationships reflected in the data. Second, data as a product: data are treated as\n",
      "products with end-to-end responsibility. Data products include metadata, accessibility options e.g., APIs, and the actual\n",
      "data. It is the equivalent of a software product that also requires additional services, such as security updates or manuals.\n",
      "Furthermore, data products adhere to the following usability characteristics: discoverable, addressable, understandable,\n",
      "trustworthy, accessible, interoperable, valuable, and secure [7]. The third principle, self-serve data platform, describes a\n",
      "dedicated data platform that provides high-level abstraction infrastructure for the domains. This is crucial to avoid\n",
      "domains to replicate technical efforts and focus on the creation of high-quality data products. Consequently, domains\n",
      "enjoy a high degree of autonomy. Fourth and finally, a federated computational governance ensures interoperability of\n",
      "data products through standardization. This is of utmost importance because data products create the greatest value\n",
      "when combined. In combination, the four principles allow organizations to overcome the limitations of centralized\n",
      "data architectures and enable organizations to become more data-driven [7]. A depiction of the resulting architectural\n",

      "location, considering appropriate data governance and data cataloging [11]. To provide access for users throughout the\n",
      "organization, data fabric uses rich metadata and a data virtualization layer [17]. The use of metadata is crucial not only\n",
      "for access and discoverability of data, but also for the automation of data integration, engineering, and data governance\n",
      "activities. This includes centralized management of data access, privacy, and compliance-related topics.\n",
      "Definition 5: Data fabric. The data fabric architecture bridges the data-knowledge-gap using knowledge-based\n",
      "integration techniques to bring together heterogeneous data, that spans across multiple sources or formats, considering\n",
      "appropriate data governance and data cataloging [11].\n",
      "Data mesh and data fabric share the same goal; they aim to enable organizations to become more data-driven. As\n",
      "such, both can work together to complement each other [12]. However, there can be data mesh without data fabric (i.e.,\n",
      "reading data from single data products only) and there can be data fabric without data mesh (i.e., if the read data does\n",
      "not follow a data product structure). Data mesh puts a strong emphasis on decentralized-domain ownership, while the\n",
      "concept of ownership is not clearly defined for data fabric.\n",
      "With these foundations at hand, we review recent literature addressing the term data mesh and its related concepts.\n",
      "Dehghani [6] first introduced the term data mesh in May 2019. Since then, multiple organizations shared knowledge,\n",
      "PoVs, and their experience in the field of data mesh [5, 29, 32]. However, peer-reviewed publications that contribute\n",
      "to the knowledge base of the novel topic data mesh are still scarce. Recent peer-reviewed publications explain the\n",
      "term data mesh [18, 24] and introduce descriptions of multiple data mesh adoptions. However, those descriptions lack\n",
      "detail and only aim to explain or illustrate the concept. Two recent case studies [15, 31] provide in-depth insights into\n",
      "data mesh adoptions in the Norwegian Labor and Welfare Administration and the Saxo Bank respectively. Both studies\n",
      "contribute valuable knowledge but are tailored to sole case studies.\n",
      "In summary, there is existing work on the topic of data mesh, however, with regard to the RQ at hand which focuses\n",

      "tor combines the related concepts of bottlenecks, scalability, and speed and is consistent with the initial concept of\n",
      "Dehghani [7]. Bottlenecks refer to a lack of capacity in the central data team and result in a backlog of data requests\n",
      "from multiple domains. As a consequence, domains are unable to scale data-driven use cases at the preferred rate. The\n",
      "concept of speed has two dimensions. It describes the time the central team needs to provide requested data and the\n",
      "time to market for new products and services.\n",
      "MF2: Leverage domain knowledge to improve data quality (𝐴, 𝐵, Γ, Δ, 𝐸,𝑍, 𝐼, 𝐾, Ξ,𝑂). In centrally governed\n",
      "organizations IT departments provide data, however, they lack domain knowledge to ensure the task-specific quality of\n",
      "the data. Interviewees emphasize the importance of domain knowledge to provide data of a higher quality.\n",
      "MF3: Break silos and empower employees through improved accessibility of data (𝐴, Γ, 𝐸,𝑍, 𝐻, Θ, 𝐼, Λ, 𝑀, Ξ,𝑂).\n",
      "Accessibility is of great importance for cross-domain data-driven use cases, however, silos within organizations prevent\n",
      "other domains to access the data. For example, the marketing department (domain A) may need to request sales (domain\n",
      "B) data to track the success of a regional marketing campaign. However, if sales fails to deliver the data, the marketing\n",
      "department loses out on valuable insights.\n",
      "MF4: Establish clear data ownership (𝐼, Λ, 𝑁). The fourth motivational factor highlights the significance of data\n",
      "ownership. It refers to the end-to-end responsibility of a data product in terms of quality and accessibility. This concept\n",
      "is comparable to traditional product ownership roles.\n",
      "MF5: Move towards modern architecture (𝑍, 𝐾, Λ). Managers and employees within an organization are aware\n",
      "of an upcoming trend in data architectures—they see how organizations throughout the industry adopt a data mesh and\n",
      "don’t wanna miss the boat (Λ). However, data mesh is not a universal approach. Hence this finding is very worrisome,\n",
      "because it may push organizations or business units toward a data mesh adoption for the wrong reasons.\n",
      "MF6: Reduce redundancies (𝐵, 𝐼,𝑂). Silos, a lack of communication, and, a lack of transparency can result in\n",
      "redundant work within large organizations. This is also true for data-related topics, such as data preparation (𝐴)\n",
      "or even whole use cases (𝑂). 𝐴 states that multiple data consumers prepare data for their specific use case but do\n",
      "not share the results of the data preparation efforts back to the organization. Consequently, multiple domains spend\n",

      "of concern (𝐴, 𝐸,𝑍, 𝐻, Θ, 𝑁,𝑂). 𝑂 notes that employees within the domain are unaware of which data are protected\n",
      "and regulated. 𝑁 warns that managers may “end up with one foot in jail” for non-compliance with data protection\n",
      "regulations. Furthermore, interviewees state the lack of a central unit results in insufficient prioritization of use cases\n",
      "and projects across domains (Δ,𝑍, 𝐼). 𝐼 argues that decentralized ownership and federated governance result in a lack of\n",
      "observability, which in turn complicates proper prioritization.\n",
      "C2: Shift of responsibility (𝐵, Γ,𝑍, Θ, 𝐼, 𝐾, Λ, 𝑁). The first main principle states that ownership shifts from a central\n",
      "authority towards the domains. However, decentralized ownership within the domains includes end-to-end responsibility\n",
      "for the accessibility and quality of the data products. This new responsibility creates a number of sub-challenges. First,\n",
      "the data product owners perceive the task to provide data for other domains as extra work (Γ, Θ, 𝐾). In addition,\n",
      "domains frequently receive no direct compensation for the data provision efforts that benefit other domains (Θ, 𝐾, 𝑁).\n",
      "Furthermore, domains’ business activity is usually not centered around the provision of data products—consequently,\n",
      "they deprioritize the task (𝐵, Γ,𝑍, 𝐼, Λ). The provision of data products includes the initial development, making the\n",
      "data accessible, and maintaining the data product. In the following, we only refer to provision.\n",
      "C3: Data product model (𝐸, Θ, 𝐼). The third challenge described by interviewees is the model of the data product.\n",
      "Data products store any kind of data and among others additionally provide metadata that allows the user’s without\n",
      "domain knowledge to interpret the data [7]. However, interviewees point out a gap between the descriptions provider\n",
      "domains deliver and the information consumer domains need to correctly interpret the data. 𝐸 states that “data modeling\n",
      "is the most crucial part in most companies and there is no standard yet on how to do this” and subsequently elaborates\n",
      "that if you “solve data modeling [...] you probably have the gold mine for data these days”.\n",
      "C4: Lack of understanding (Δ,𝑍, Θ, Λ,𝑋). The fourth challenge refers to a lack of knowledge regarding the\n",

      "centrally to ensure compliance in the early phases of the transition. Furthermore, interviewees state that it can be\n",

      "Moreover, interviewees address issues related to the data product model (C3) with central enforcement of metadata\n",
      "and data quality standards (Δ,𝑍, 𝐻, Θ, 𝐼). However, this measure has limitations that are important to stress. First,\n",
      "organizations should define standards in cooperation with domains and not top-down. Furthermore, organizations\n",
      "should only enforce standards when applicable to allow domains a degree of freedom and flexibility to avoid frustration.\n",
      "For example, if a column in a data set matches the predefined syntax of an email, then standards for email data should\n",
      "be enforced. Additionally, in line with the fourth main principle of data mesh: federated computational governance,\n",
      "organizations should use automation to ensure compliance with standards and fast operations.\n",
      "BP2: Empower & observe (𝐵, Δ,𝑍, 𝐻, Θ, 𝐼, 𝐾, 𝑀, 𝑁, Ξ,𝑂). The second best practice addresses the shift of responsi-\n",

      "One of the key ideas of data mesh is to leverage domain knowledge. However, a central department needs to provide\n",
      "the technical infrastructure, support, templates, and guidelines to facilitate the provision of high-quality data products\n",
      "(𝐵, Δ,𝑍, 𝐻, Θ, 𝐼, 𝑁). This finding is in line with the third main principle of data mesh, the self-serve data platform\n",
      "highlighting the importance to empower the domains. On multiple occasions during the interviews, interviewees stress\n",
      "the importance to observe the quality and usage of data products (𝑍, Θ, 𝐼, 𝐾, 𝑀, Ξ,𝑂) pointing out two major benefits.\n",
      "First, usage data of data products can motivate data product owners within the domains, because it visualizes the impact\n",

      "the data product has. This data can help domains to highlight their importance within the organization and provides\n",
      "them with leverage to negotiate additional resources (C5). Furthermore, we suggest that organizations observe and\n",
      "automatically score the quality of data products. This score should include a metadata score, a data quality score, and\n",
      "availability metrics. 𝑂 argues that a data product quality score creates an incentive for data product owners to ensure a\n",
      "high quality of the data product (C3). Δ further emphasizes, “it doesn’t need a lot of escalation [...] just by knowing it\n",
      "will be reported [...] they handle it very differently now”. Therefore, we suggest that a central steering unit tracks and\n",
      "ranks key data products to nudge data product owners to provide high-quality data products.\n",
      "BP3: Iterate inexpensive, small, broad, quick, & successful (𝐴, 𝐵, Γ, Δ, 𝐸,𝑍, 𝐻, Θ, 𝐼, 𝐾, Λ, 𝑀, 𝑁, Ξ,𝑂). While the\n",

      "fine-grained multi-step process that guides professionals through the data mesh exploration & bootstrap phase with\n",
      "respect to organizational challenges [7]. First, data mesh initiatives should start where the budget is as financial resources\n",
      "are crucial for the success of the transition (𝑍, C5). If central IT has the resources to kick-start the transformation\n",
      "towards a data mesh they should be responsible. If the organization is already highly decentralized, influential domains\n",
      "should lead the way. Either way, communication across multiple domains and stakeholder from central IT is crucial\n",
      "across the iterative transformation phase. In the next step, domains and central IT develop a concept that considers\n",
      "all stakeholders’ interests to ensure future adoption. Afterward, the main driver of the data mesh initiative should\n",
      "select multiple pilot data products. The pilot data products should be: across multiple use-cases (𝐴,𝑍, Θ, Λ), inexpensive\n",
      "(𝐴, Δ, 𝐾, Λ, 𝑀), small (𝐴, Λ, 𝑀), but impactful (𝐴,𝑍, 𝐼, 𝐾, Λ, 𝑁,𝑂), and allow for easy-wins (𝐴, 𝐻, Λ, Ξ,𝑂). Consequently,\n",
      "drivers of the data mesh initiative are able to present successful use cases to get approval from the top management\n",
      "and promote data mesh throughout the organization (𝐻, Ξ,𝑂). Simultaneously, the inexpensive and small approach\n",
      "guarantees acceptance for the initial pilot program.\n",
      "BP4: Dodge the hype (𝐵, Δ, 𝐻, 𝐼𝐾, Λ, Ξ,𝑂). Before organizations decide to adopt a data mesh, they should go through\n",
      "a thorough assessment of their current data management systems, architecture, its shortcomings, and the potential\n",
      "benefits of a data mesh. Moreover, they should consider the organizational structure and size. If the organization decides\n",

      "BP5: Small team, high commitment (𝐴, Λ). Shift of responsibility (C2) highlights the challenge that domain\n",
      "employees perceive the provision of data products as extra work and do not prioritize the task. Since organizations have\n",
      "to work with limited resources (C5) managers need to carefully consider the number of employees and the capacities\n",
      "those employees can spend on the provision of a data product. Our interviews show that managers should favor a\n",
      "smaller team with people dedicated to data product provision tasks over a bigger team where commitment is lower\n",
      "for two main reasons. First, there is no prioritization conflict, because the main prioritization is the provision of data\n",

      "The most prominent impact we observe is the improvement of data accessibility (I1) (𝐴, 𝐵, Γ, Δ,𝑍, 𝐻, Θ, Λ, 𝑁,𝑂),\n",
      "which directly relates to MF4. Furthermore, interviewees observe an increase in speed (I2) (Γ, Δ, 𝐸, 𝐻, 𝐼, 𝐾, Λ, Ξ). As we\n",
      "describe in MF1, speed has two dimensions. First, time to get access and second, time to market for new products and\n",

      "with a change in employees’ mindset and a broad set of measures. Additionally, we note an increase in data trust (I6)\n",

      "In this section, we discuss the results, highlight contributions, acknowledge limitations, and point out future work.\n",
      "5.1\n",
      "Summary, Contributions & Literature Embedding\n",
      "Data mesh is a socio-technical concept including architectural aspects that enables organizations to become more\n",
      "data-driven. However, the architectural concept of data mesh is novel and needs further scientific exploration—especially\n",
      "with regard to motivational factors, challenges, best practices, impact, and archetypes. The work at hand addresses this\n",
      "shortcoming by contributing generalizable knowledge for organizations that transition or plan to transition toward a\n",
      "data mesh.\n",
      "We find that interviewees’ perception of data mesh and the associated motivational factors are generally in line\n",
      "with Dehghani’s [7] proposed concept. The interviewees formulate the need for faster, scalable solutions to reduce\n",
      "bottlenecks and leverage domain knowledge (MF1-3). Moreover, the establishment of data ownership and reduction\n",
      "silos and redundancies is also well documented (MF4, MF6). However, interviewees put a strong emphasis on speed with\n",
      "regard to time to market for new use cases and time until requested data is accessible (MF1). Consequently, professionals\n",
      "need to carefully weigh design decisions against possible negative impacts on speed. Furthermore, we find that the\n",
      "current hype around data mesh motivates stakeholders within organizations to adopt data mesh for the sake of adoption\n",
      "(MF5). However, data mesh is not a universal concept for data architectures and data mesh adoption should not become\n",
      "an end in itself. This insight highlights the need for clear fact-based discussions and communication. Priebe et al. [24]\n",
      "address this issue with a preliminary review of selected big data architectures.\n",
      "In addition to motivational factors, we find several challenges that are partly reflected in current literature. First,\n",
      "we identify the transition towards federated data governance as a main challenge (C1). Vestues et al. [31] provide\n",
      "further evidence for this challenge as they argue that federated governance can be unfeasible in specific situations\n",
      "and highlight the importance of central units to provide cross-domain insights. Furthermore, they raise concerns\n",
      "regarding the rightful access to data products [31]. Podlesny et al. [23] extend this argument and provide extensive\n",
      "12\n",
      "Bode and Kühl, et al.\n",
      "analysis for privacy challenges in data mesh. Additionally, Joshi et al. [15] describe agreement among domains and\n",
      "compliance issues as a moving target [15]. In alignment with Vestues et al. [31], we identify the shift of responsibility\n",
      "as a main challenge (C2). The authors argue that domains lack competencies, motivation, and resources to provide\n",
      "data products [31]. Lack of resources (C5) and acceptance issues (C6) are well-established challenges in the context\n",
      "of organizational and cultural change management; professionals and researchers should consider the rich body of\n",
      "literature to complement the findings of this work (e.g., [4, 15, 21, 31]). A hype-related lack of understanding (C4)\n",
      "strongly relates to the move toward modern architectures (MF5), however, otherwise finds little attention in recent\n",
      "publications. Neither does challenge C3, the data product model. This is an interesting finding as interviewees mention\n",
      "the challenge across multiple use cases.\n",
      "Addressing the aforementioned challenges, we formulate best practices (BP1-6). First, to address C1 and C3, we\n",
      "argue that professionals should embrace elements of data fabric (BP1). A recent study supports this claim. Whyte\n",
      "et al. [32] reason that organizations should embrace decentralized and centralized capabilities for the next-generation\n",
      "data platform. Furthermore, we argue that organizations need to empower domains and closely observe and track\n",
      "their progress (BP2) to address C2, C3, and C5. In line with Dehghani [7], we describe the need to empower domains.\n",
      "However, the great importance to observe data products as motivation for providers and for prioritization purposes is\n",
      "novel and needs further research. Furthermore, Dehghani [7] suggests an iterative approach for the transition towards a\n",
      "data mesh. We can confirm that approach after the analysis of our interview transcripts and provide further guidelines\n",
      "in BP3 to navigate organizational challenges (C5, C6).\n",
      "Dodge the hype (BP4) is unique in the context of data mesh, but not in the context of artificial intelligence (AI), e.g.,\n",
      "Burgess [3] describes issues related to the usage of hype-related terminology like blockchain, AI, etc. We further suggest\n",
      "professionals favor small dedicated teams over a larger number of employees, that provide data products (BP5). This\n",
      "best practice addresses the need for prioritization and motivation of data product providers (C2, C5) [31]. Lastly, we\n",
      "argue that organizations should consider a data product steward (BP6) to ensure data quality, fitness, and accessibility.\n",
      "In cases where organizations have a strong need to control data product access and overview use cases, this may be an\n",
      "interesting consideration. However, we acknowledge that BP6 somewhat conflicts with Dehghani’s [7] emphasis on\n",

      "more data-driven organization (I5), an increase in trust (I6), reliability (I7), and data and analytics use-cases (I8). The\n",
      "overall positive impacts highlight that organizations can reap the expected benefits even in the early stages of the\n",
      "transition, confirming Dehghani’s [7] perspective on data mesh impacts.\n",
      "Finally, we present two archetypes of organizations that adopt the data mesh concept: Startup & scaleup (A1) and\n",
      "established organizations (A2). We argue that professionals need to weigh best practices according to their individual\n",

      "To answer our research question, we conduct 15 semi-structured expert interviews. The qualitative nature of our work\n",
      "results in limited quantitative validity. However, we justify the qualitative approach with the novelty of the research\n",
      "topic. Nevertheless, future research should investigate the findings on a quantitative level. Our main contribution are\n",
      "Data Mesh: Motivational Factors, Challenges, and Best Practices\n",
      "13\n",
      "best practices (BP1-6) for professionals who move towards a data mesh. However, we acknowledge that these practices\n",
      "are only applicable to a certain degree depending on the organizations’ individual situation. To address this shortcoming\n",
      "we present two archetypes, yet those archetypes lack quantitative evidence. Future work should further examine\n",
      "archetypes and provide more fine-grained recommendations for organizations. In this context, researchers should\n",
      "investigate data mesh in small and medium-sized organizations to extend the framework of archetypes. Moreover,\n",
      "future work should more deeply cover the technological realization of data mesh. For example, how to integrate data\n",
      "warehouses, data lakes, blob storage, or data catalogs to realize the data mesh concept.\n",

      "CONCLUSION\n",
      "As the supply of data grows exponentially, organizations need to adjust their data management systems and architectures\n",
      "to scale data and analytics use cases successfully. Data mesh is a socio-technical concept with architectural aspects\n",
      "that enables organizations in that endeavor, with the goal to become data-driven and promote data democratization.\n",
      "However, so far, the concept of data mesh was highly abstract with little empirical substantiation. Consequently,\n",
      "organizations and researchers need further insights from industry experts on how to successfully adopt a data mesh\n",
      "concept.\n",
      "Our interview study shows that organizations struggle with the transition towards federated data governance, the\n",
      "shift of responsibility when providing data products, and the data product model. Furthermore, interviewees state\n",
      "challenges related to a lack of understanding of the data mesh terminology, lack of resources, and acceptance issues\n",
      "within the organization.\n",
      "With this work, we support professionals with best practices to address their main challenges. First, organizations\n",
      "should consider including elements of data fabric to counteract challenges related to federated data governance.\n",
      "Furthermore, we highlight the importance of organizations empowering the domain and observing the performance\n",
      "of data products. Additionally, it is crucial for organizations to create quick, inexpensive wins over a small but broad\n",
      "portfolio of pilot data products. Within the domains, organizations should prefer a small number of employees that\n",
      "dedicate the majority of their time to the development, provision, and maintenance of data products over a large amount\n",
      "that spends less time.\n",
      "To provide more fine-grained assistance and advice for professionals and researchers, we describe and map our\n",
      "findings in the context of two archetypes: Startups & scaleups, as well as established organizations. Future research\n",
      "should further investigate best practices on a quantitative level to strengthen the validity of our results presented.\n",
      "Furthermore, researchers should assess organizational archetypes, especially in the context of small and medium-sized\n",
      "organizations, to provide fine-grained recommendations. A promising field of research also lies in the shift from the\n",
      "individual current state towards data mesh.\n",

      "adoption of digital technologies on dairy farms (Gabriel and\n",

      "generated from dairy farms. These data are used to help farmers\n",
      "monitor their farms, make decisions, and achieve their goals\n",
      "around production, proﬁtability, and cattle welfare and also to help\n",

      "Additional availability of farm data also allows advanced\n",

      "Wolfert et al. (2017) identiﬁed several major challenges in\n",

      "serving as a platform for networking, dialog, and shaping agendas\n",
      "for positive changes. The WEF summarizes the challenges in\n",
      "digital agriculture in three categories: fragmentation, standards,\n",
      "and access. A recent study by Fadul-Pacheco et al. (2022) describes\n",
      "data-oriented issues and demands of dairy farms. It was found\n",
      "that dairy farmers and non-dairy farmers (related to the dairy\n",
      "industry) believed that data sharing is important. However, issues\n",
      "with data ownership and data quality represented a signiﬁcant area\n",
      "of concern. A signiﬁcant portion was unsure about the chain of\n",
      "custody of data. Non-farmers (e.g., researchers and organizations\n",
      "without dairy farming expertise) were concerned about the lack of\n",
      "integration of data and, in some cases, not aware of the usefulness of\n",
      "data integration. The issue of trust when sharing data was raised in\n",
      "the study by Jakku et al. (2019), indicating that transparency, trust,\n",
      "and data ownership are major issues in sharing data. This highlights\n",
      "the need for a framework that ensures good data quality, eﬀective\n",
      "data integration, transparent data use and ownership, and eﬀective\n",
      "use of the data to build analytics and predictive systems. This, in\n",
      "turn, demonstrates that there is a requirement for a reliable data\n",
      "sharing framework in the dairy industry context which addresses\n",
      "the above issues.\n",
      "In this study, we introduce a data mesh architecture, CowMesh,\n",
      "that addresses the challenges in data-driven dairy farming as\n",
      "described above. Speciﬁcally, we propose an architecture with a\n",

      "the CowMesh architecture. Key advantages and opportunities for\n",
      "the architecture are discussed in Section 5, and ﬁnally, Section 6\n",
      "concludes the study.\n",
      "2. Related work\n",
      "According to WEF (2023), the key challenges around data in\n",
      "the agricultural domain can be summarized as follows:\n",
      "• Fragmentation: Data are gathered from a variety of sources\n",
      "(sensors, satellites, etc.) and made available as diﬀerent topical\n",
      "silos (soil data, seed data, etc.);\n",
      "• Standards: There is no global standard or standardization\n",
      "body facilitating the expression of agricultural data;\n",
      "• Access: Data need to be exchanged and connected in order to\n",
      "deliver value.\n",
      "However, these challenges are actually not restricted to\n",
      "agriculture and are a larger concern across many diﬀerent\n",
      "industry sectors. The proposal for making scientiﬁc data Findable,\n",
      "Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR; Wilkinson et al.,\n",
      "2016) is a pragmatic approach toward producing data in a better\n",
      "way. It has been designed with the scientiﬁc community in mind,\n",
      "but the principles are more globally applicable. FAIR pushes\n",
      "forward a number of core principles which align largely with the\n",
      "W3C Data on the Web Best Practices (DWBP)1 but do not push\n",
      "forward any particular technology stack.\n",
      "According to both FAIR and DWBP, vocabularies are a pillar\n",
      "of data publication. In the agricultural domain, the thesaurus\n",

      "for describing agricultural concepts uniformly and in multiple\n",

      "objective is to support queries around land ownership and arable\n",

      "We remark that, although vocabularies such as AGROVOC can\n",
      "support the creation of data portals aimed at particular needs, there\n",
      "is still a requirement for a more holistic approach. As outlined in the\n",
      "study by WEF (2023), there are a number of services needed around\n",
      "these portals in order to unlock their capabilities. It could also be\n",
      "interesting to consider creating a more ﬂexible alternative to data\n",
      "portals constructed on a data aggregation approach. To achieve this\n",
      "aim, we propose the adoption of the recent and growing approach\n",
      "of the data to the agricultural domain (Joshi et al., 2021; Butte and\n",

      "3. The CowMesh architecture\n",
      "In this section, we will introduce the CowMesh architecture\n",
      "by ﬁrst providing a general overview of the Data Mesh approach\n",
      "and then explaining how this is adopted in our context. Finally, we\n",
      "describe the central Semantic Layer component, which is a Data\n",
      "Fabric, and its key role in CowMesh.\n",
      "3.1. The data mesh\n",
      "The data mesh concept was introduced by Dehghani (2022a,b)\n",
      "to deﬁne a set of principles for publishing data (Christ et al., 2022).\n",
      "From a technology point of view, a data mesh can be implemented\n",
      "using a variety of solutions and standards. The only particularity\n",
      "is the focus of application programming interface (API) to replace\n",
      "the (manual) handling of data dumps across systems. The novelty\n",
      "of the data mesh approach is not the data integration itself but\n",
      "rather how it is approached and considered from an organizational\n",
      "point of view. In particular, a data mesh is centered around four\n",
      "core concepts as follows:\n",

      "• The preservation of domain ownership for the diﬀerent\n",
      "domains may serve. As teams working together in a company\n",
      "system, the diﬀerent data domains are expected to directly\n",
      "collaborate with each other and own their work—for example,\n",
      "in terms of data exchange or analytical work usage.\n",
      "• The notion of data products replaces the older idea of data\n",
      "assets. The application of a product logic to data assets turns\n",
      "them into things that need to match a demand, whose value is\n",
      "assessed and production cost studied. Data domains may share\n",
      "datasets as product and/or analytical applications leveraging\n",
      "one or more other data products as a product of their own.\n",
      "• A data infrastructure platform is put in place to let each\n",
      "data domain easily make data products available to the rest\n",
      "of an organization. This platform must not be limited to a\n",
      "particular domain and should facilitate both the creation and\n",

      "(HTTP, CSS, etc.). Finally, the Web often uses diﬀerent attribution\n",
      "mechanisms such as Creative Common licensing5 and document\n",

      "The objective of the CowMesh is to add value to the\n",
      "dairy industry through intelligent data processing. To do this,\n",
      "the products need access to clean data from the farms to act\n",

      "encourage farms and data sources to share data, such that products\n",
      "can provide analytical and predictive insights, which adds value to\n",
      "the dairy farms.\n",
      "• Trust: Data domains and data products can rely on the\n",
      "accuracy and quality of the data they are working with, as\n",
      "well as the security of the data and the trustworthiness of the\n",
      "data sources. By establishing trust in the data and the data\n",
      "sources, organizations can make better decisions and extract\n",
      "more value from the data.\n",
      "• Privacy and transparency: By using the decentralized\n",
      "property of the data mesh, data can be privately held. The\n",
      "nature of the CowMesh allows the private data domains to\n",
      "decide how much data they want to make accessible to the\n",
      "CowMesh. In addition, the chain of ownership can be tracked\n",
      "and audited, ensuring transparency and compliance.\n",
      "• FAIR data: FAIR refers to Findable, Accessible, Interoperable,\n",
      "and Reusable. By ensuring that data follow the data\n",
      "ontology and the access is standardized through the set\n",
      "of access protocols and interfaces (e.g., well-deﬁned APIs),\n",
      "organizations can make it easier for users to discover and\n",
      "access relevant data, as well as combine and analyze data from\n",
      "multiple sources. This can lead to more accurate insights and\n",
      "better decision-making.\n",
      "• Decentralized interoperability: CowMesh combines the\n",
      "contrasting characteristics of data mesh and data fabric and\n",
      "enables data and products to be decentralized while providing\n",
      "one central protocol to be followed, therefore enabling\n",
      "interoperability.\n",
      "• Governance: Governance becomes easier, as the CowMesh\n",

      "This makes the diﬀerent products follow the standards and\n",

      "CowMesh is a service which the data domains and data products\n",

      "the corresponding source and maintaining transparency. Some\n",
      "of the ways in which CowMesh can be monetized are as\n",
      "follows:\n",
      "• Data use: The data are accessed through the API, and the use\n",
      "is tracked by the semantic layer. Using this, the total data used\n",

      "various data governance policies programmatically (policy as a code), including data quality, access control, and privacy.\n",
      "A product also has various interfaces that define and enable interactions with other data products, data sources, data sinks,\n",

      "ID1.2. Types of Data Products. We identified two types of data products: atomic data products and composite data\n",

      "1. Introduction\n",
      "In the dynamic world of data science and machine learning, the foundation of meaningful analysis\n",
      "lies in robust data architecture. Over the past few decades, a multitude of analytical data architectures\n",
      "have been proposed and established, ranging from traditional, such as data warehouse (DWH), to\n",
      "more modern approaches, such as data mesh. However, understanding their nuances, similarities, and\n",
      "differences can be challenging.\n",
      "In the present study, we aimed to provide a systematic overview and a comparative analysis of\n",
      "various analytical data architectures, including DWH, data lake, data lakehouse, and data mesh. We\n",
      "delved into the details of classic data warehouse (both Kimball and Inmon styles) [1,2], Gartner’s logical\n",

      "structure presented in the previous section, can be found on the website mentioned. A distinction\n",
      "is also shown between Kimball and Inmon DWHs. Even if variants such as (near) real-time DWH\n",
      "and the like with stream processing have emerged, data integration in DWH usually occurs with\n",
      "batch-based ETL (or ELT) processing. Regarding storage technology, DWH is based on relational\n",
      "database technology. As shown in Figure 1, the data vault architecture is presented as a specialization\n",
      "of the DWH architecture. Contrarily, a data lake typically uses ﬁle/object storage (Hadoop, AWS S3,\n",
      "or Azure Blob Store in the cloud). Stream processing is added to data integration.\n",
      "2.2. Logical Data Warehouse\n",
      "Building on this, in the present study, we want to take explore further the concept of the\n",

      "2.3. Persistence Kappa Architectures\n",
      "The combination of several repositories, i.e., different data storage technologies, has already been\n",
      "applied and named “polyglot persistence.” This term was apparently ﬁrst used by Scott Leberknight\n",
      "in 2008 and then by Martin Fowler in 2011. It basically means that every midsize company should\n",
      "combine technologies, such as distributed ﬁle or object storage systems and relational and graph\n",
      "databases, even within a single application, as needed. Polyglot persistence is more of a principle that\n",
      "advocates the use of a polyglot data store, i.e., a data storage solution that combines different storage\n",
      "technologies, as an architectural component, i.e., the lambda and kappa architectures. However, they\n",
      "are not full data architectures, but rather focus on the data integration function. Lambda combines\n",
      "batch processing in a so-called batch layer with stream processing in a so-called speed layer, whereas\n",
      "kappa relies exclusively on streaming (possibly through log processing or change data capture). Both\n",
      "architectures were developed and published in 2014/15.\n",
      "2.4. Data Lakehouse\n",
      "Even if the term “data lakehouse” appears to have been used earlier, it was coined clearly in a blog\n",
      "by Databricks in 2020 and developed (also sponsored by Databricks) by Inmon et al. [8]. According to\n",
      "this blog, a data lakehouse is deﬁned as “a new, open paradigm that combines the best elements of data\n",
      "lakes and data warehouses.” In this respect, the basic idea is comparable to the previously described\n",
      "logical DWH according to Gartner. Contrarily, the DataLakeho use (at least in the case of Databricks)\n",
      "does not rely on a combination of several storage technologies, but on ﬁle/object storage that has\n",
      "been expanded to include transaction consistency. Since the boundaries are more ﬂuid as compared\n",
      "with those of logical DWH, a distinction is not made between data lake and DWH as architectural\n",
      "components, but between data records with raw and prepared data (“Curated Data”).\n",
      "2.5. Data Fabric and Data Mesh\n",
      "The combination of different data storage and integration techniques, but not limited to concrete\n",
      "architecture archetypes, such as data lake or DWH, led to the term “data fabric,” which was originally\n",
      "coined in 2015 by George Kurian of NetApp and then by Gartner [9]. According to the authors, data\n",
      "fabric is deﬁned as “a design concept to achieve reusable and advanced data integration services, data\n",
      "pipelines, and semantics, aimed at ﬂexible and integrated data delivery.” Data fabric can be seen as the\n",
      "successor and generalization of logical DWH. It builds on the idea of polyglot persistence or polyglot\n",
      "data store that combines storage approaches, including relational databases, graph databases, and/or\n",
      "ﬁle/object storage.\n",
      "A main focus of the data fabric concept is metadata, which, according to Gartner, comprises an\n",

      "artiﬁcial intelligent or machine learning.Gartas.”Der Lans [10] differentiates transactional services, the\n",
      "logical DWH, reporting and analysis tools are not seen as the core of the data fabric concept, but fall\n",
      "under the responsibility of the data consumer.\n",
      "Data fabric is basically already leading the basic idea of “Data Products,” even if this terminology\n",
      "is not used explicitly. This ﬁnally resulted in the idea of a data mesh according to Dehghani [5].\n",
      "Dehghani argues that the existing centralized and monolithic data management platforms, which\n",
      "lack clear domain boundaries and ownership of domain data, fail in large enterprises with a diverse\n",
      "number of data sources and consumers. In a data mesh, the domains must display their records as a\n",
      "domain host internal data and make them available as data products. Although the individual domain\n",

      "7 of 8\n",
      "5. Discussion\n",
      "The comparative analysis presented in this paper provides a comprehensive overview of the\n",
      "current landscape of data architectures. However, as with any rapidly evolving ﬁeld, new questions\n",
      "and areas for future research emerge.\n",
      "1) Interoperability and Integration: As organizations often employ multiple data architectures,\n",
      "it is unclear how these different architectures can interoperate and integrate with each other. Future\n",
      "research should explore strategies and technologies to ensure effective data integration across different\n",
      "architectures.\n",
      "2) Evolution of Data Architectures: As data management continues to evolve, the architectures\n",
      "underpinning it will also evolve. How the emerging technologies and trends, including artiﬁcial\n",
      "intelligence and edge computing, might shape the future of data architectures should be investigated\n",
      "in the future.\n",
      "3) Performance Benchmarking: Although this paper has compared the theoretical aspects of\n",
      "different data architectures, empirical studies that could benchmark their performances under different\n",
      "scenarios would be valuable, as such studies could provide more concrete data to guide practitioners.\n",
      "4) Security and Privacy: With the increasing importance of data privacy and security, future\n",
      "research should focus on these aspects in the context of different data architectures. How can these\n",
      "architectures ensure data security and comply with privacy regulations?\n",
      "5) Adoption Challenges: Implementing a new data architecture is not without its challenges.\n",
      "Future work should explore these challenges in more detail and develop strategies to overcome them.\n",
      "6) Impact of Data Architecture on Data Science: How does the choice of data architecture impact\n",
      "the work of data scientists? This is an important question that deserves further exploration.\n",
      "To summarize, although this paper provides a comprehensive comparison of different data\n",
      "architectures, it also opens up several avenues for future research. As we continue to explore the\n",
      "complex landscape of data architecture, ongoing discussion and research are crucial to keep up with\n",
      "the rapid pace of change in this ﬁeld.\n",
      "6. Conclusions\n",
      "Our analysis has illuminated the distinct characteristics and similarities among four key data\n",
      "architectures (data warehouse, data lake, data lakehouse, and data mesh). Although DWHs offer\n",
      "a traditional, structured approach to data management, Data Lakes provide a more ﬂexible and\n",
      "scalable solution for storing raw data. Contrarily, data lakehouses attempt to combine the best of both\n",
      "worlds, offering the structured analysis of DWHs and the ﬂexibility of data lakes. Lastly, data mesh\n",
      "represents a paradigm shift toward a more decentralized approach to data architecture, focusing on\n",
      "domain-oriented data ownership.\n",
      "However, a one-size-ﬁts-all solution in data architecture is lacking. The choice of architecture\n",
      "depends on various factors, including the nature of the data, speciﬁc use case, scalability requirements,\n",
      "and existing IT infrastructure, among others. Therefore, practitioners should carefully consider these\n",
      "factors when selecting the most suitable data architecture for their speciﬁc needs.\n",
      "In conclusion, as the ﬁeld of data management continues to evolve, so too will the architectures\n",
      "that underpin it. We hope that the results of our comparative analysis will serve as a valuable guide\n",
      "for practitioners when navigating the complex landscape of data architecture, aiding them in making\n",
      "informed decisions that best suit their speciﬁc applications.\n",

      "1. Introduction \n",
      "The Data Mesh emerges as a necessary paradigm shift that will enable companies to become truly data-oriented, \n",
      "implementing an architecture that brings the opposite of the current models for efficient data product cooperation [1]. \n",
      "From a more structural perspective, data is organized into domains and data teams manage themselves and carry out \n",
      "their own work in an agile and product-oriented way. However, this paradigm shift does not occur only on a structural \n",
      "level, but also on an organizational level - as the way data teams are organized will become focused on a specific \n",
      "domain and therefore decentralized [2]. The Data Mesh allows for the provision of complex management, access, and \n",
      "support components through the connectivity layer it implements - data from different locations will now be connected \n",
      "in the Mesh [3]. Recently, Zhamak Dehghani began taking the first steps in consolidating what might be the core \n",
      "principles and logical architecture of a Data Mesh [4]. Although this initial consolidation is relevant, the topic still \n",
      "lacks scientific contributions and research artefacts to support it. Therefore, this paper aims to consolidate the \n",
      "background knowledge regarding the concept of Data Mesh and the current known approaches and features, thus \n",
      "serving as a state of the art review for this topic. The contribution of this paper is twofold: i) present a comprehensive \n",
      "overview of the Data Mesh concepts, its main guiding principles and how they advance the state of the art in data \n",
      "systems; ii) describe two recent implementations, identifying their main differences in terms of followed approaches. \n",
      "This knowledge is crucial for a conceptual formalization that serves as basis for future contributions in this field.  \n",
      "In this paper, section 2 presents the literature review process and the background knowledge. Section 3 describes \n",
      "the features and approaches followed in the design and implementation of the Data Mesh. Section 4 presents two \n",
      "current approaches. Finally, section 5 discusses these approaches and concludes with some remarks. \n",
      "2. Background Knowledge \n",
      "To clarify the literature review process, this section starts by giving an overview of the steps and criteria that were \n",
      "followed. Due to the novelty of the Data Mesh topic, currently, there are no scientific contributions specifically related \n",
      "to the topic. Therefore, other reliable sources of contributions were analysed. For the remaining concepts (e.g.: Data \n",
      "Warehouse), priority was given to papers published from 2015 onwards - the exception was papers with a relevant \n",
      "number of citations. Some keywords used in reference databases such as \"Scopus\", \"Research Gate\" and \"Mendeley\", \n",
      "were \"Data Lake\", “Data Mesh”, “Domain Driven Approach”, among others. YouTube videos and blogs were used \n",
      "to collect information about the Data Mesh concept. The most relevant information was selected, analysed and \n",
      "compose the background knowledge discussed in this section. \n",
      "The production and consumption of data is a constant in today’s world [5]. Clearly, the way data is produced and \n",
      "consumed nowadays is nowhere near the way this phenomenon occurred a few decades ago. Some state that a decade \n",
      "ago, what was considered \"a great dataset\", would nowadays be probably considered absurd [6]. The rapid evolution \n",
      "of Big Data [5] has led to some confusion on how to explain it, thus diverging between \"what Big Data is\" and \"what \n",
      "Big Data does\" [7]. With the observation of the different definitions [8–10],[11],[12], it is possible to conclude that to \n",
      "define Big Data, it is necessary to go into detail about its characteristics. Doug Laney formulated the 3Vs model \n",
      "(Volume, Variety, and Velocity) in 2001, and this model served as the basis for defining Big Data for a decade [13], \n",
      "considering that these would be the three main challenges when dealing with Big Data, also forming its main \n",
      "characteristics. With the continuous work in Big Data, it was possible to see that the 3Vs model was incomplete, and \n",
      "that two more Vs could be added to it: veracity and value [5]. Although these five main characteristics have been \n",
      "defined, other authors identify even more characteristics such as variability, complexity, ambiguity, viscosity, and \n",
      "virality [7]. In an organization, the operational data alone does not allow to support decision-making processes. For \n",
      "this to happen, there must be mechanisms that extract perceptible analytical value from this operational data, so that \n",
      "it can reach the respective stakeholders [14]. The phenomenon of Data Warehousing emerged as a response to this \n",
      "imminent need to use the data produced by organizations to generate value [15]. According to Kimball, Data \n",
      "Warehouses can be summarized as systems that ingest operational data (over which they have no quality control) and \n",
      "hold as output the analytical value for decision-making [14]. The purpose of this collection is to conduct data analysis \n",
      "to support decision-making [15]. Inmon also defines a Data Warehouse as being a data repository that supports \n",
      "decision-making. Kimball & Ross define the structure of a Data Warehouse as the integration of four distinct \n",
      "components: source transactions, Extract Transform Load (ETL) System, data presentation area, and Business \n",
      " \n",
      "Inês Araújo Machado  et al. / Procedia Computer Science 196 (2022) 263–271 \n",

      "Inês Araújo Machado et al. / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2021) 000–000 \n",
      " 3 \n",
      "Intelligence (BI) application [14]. In short, the Data Warehouse is a repository that stores the organization's data, and \n",
      "that enhances its analysis [5]. The Data Warehouse is widely accepted and implemented, and its role has changed over \n",
      "the years. These changes are related to the characteristics of Big Data and the need for advanced analytics – without \n",
      "these changes, Data Warehouses would not be adequate in the support of Big Data contexts [5]. Therefore, the \n",
      "scientific community began to study the modernization of the Data Warehouse, in order to accommodate these several \n",
      "changes [16]. The concept of Big Data Warehouse emerges as the way to overcome the difficulties experienced by \n",
      "Data Warehouses when processing Big Data [8]. It is possible to define a Big Data Warehouse as a system presenting \n",
      "flexible storage, accompanied by adequate scalability and performance. These systems also focus on low latency when \n",
      "it comes to data ingestion and analytical workloads of complex nature [17]. It is possible to conclude that, considering \n",
      "the challenging Big Data characteristics, there was an evolution from a Data Warehouse to a Big Data Warehouse. \n",
      "The concept of Data Lake dates back to a decade ago, through James Dixon, and was partially devalued at the time \n",
      "because it was believed to be a Hadoop marketing label [18]. However, the concept has remained and has grown over \n",

      "where it is stored in its \"As-Is\" form, remaining in this state until the need for processing emerges. This addition of \n",
      "new raw data does not interfere with the data structures already present in the Lake, which allows to continuously \n",

      "it is possible to conclude that the former deals with three types of raw data (unstructured, semi-structured and \n",
      "unstructured), while the latter mainly deals with processed and structured data. Storage costs are much higher in Data \n",
      "Warehouse environments, and this type of repository is less agile compared to the Data Lake [19]. There is also a \n",
      "difference regarding their users, as the Data Warehouse mainly targets professional business users (e.g., managers and \n",
      "directors), while the Data Lake mainly targets data scientists [19]. In short, the Data Lake corresponds to a pool that \n",
      "accepts structured, semi-structured and unstructured data, and theoretically scales to an infinite amount of raw data. \n",
      "The Data Lake can be considered more effective and efficient to deal with heavy workloads, compared to the already \n",

      "Zhamak Dehghani argues that the current data architectures are in a state of crisis, and therefore the expression \n",
      "\"paradigm shift\" show up, being associated with Data Mesh [2]. In the last three years, there has been a significant \n",
      "increase of interest and investment by companies in areas such as Big Data and Artificial Intelligence. Between 2018 \n",
      "and 2019 there was an investment of 66% compared to the previous year. However, contrary to the expectations, the \n",
      "satisfaction of the companies has decreased (regarding the recognition of the importance of these technologies to \n",
      "increase competitiveness and value). Only between 2018 and 2019, there was a decrease of 19% in this area [2]. \n",
      "According to Zhamak Dehghani, this fact shows how there are still serious gaps in the adopted architectures [2], \n",
      "although there was an evolution (from Data Warehouses) to the present day (Data Lakes in the cloud). There is \n",
      "currently an overload in the data teams in response to the growing needs of the organization, ranging from ad-hoc \n",
      "exploration to central ETL pipeline management. There is an unsatisfactory alignment between the organizational \n",
      "needs and the architectures instituted [21]. These two facts lead to this overload felt by the data teams and the \n",
      "discontent of various investors. Although in software engineering there has been an evolution from monolithic \n",
      "architectures to microservice architectures, in data engineering this change has not happened yet [1]. The Data Mesh \n",
      "arises as a paradigm shift that occurs both at the technological and organizational levels. This change has the purpose \n",
      "of solving the problems such as loss of the nature of the data itself, high costs related to the management of monolithic \n",
      "architectures (e.g., Data Lakes), significant pressure on data teams, among others.  \n",
      "3.1. Features of a Data Mesh \n",
      "The main purpose of the Data Mesh is to create a decentralized data architecture that enables the extraction of \n",
      "large-scale analytical data. In this context, scale can be understood as the adaptation to the proliferation of data sources \n",
      "[4]. In this sense, Zhamak Deghani argues that a Data Mesh should be based on four core principles: domain-oriented \n",
      "decentralized data ownership and architecture, data as a product, self-serve data platform, and federated \n",
      "266 \n",
      "Inês Araújo Machado  et al. / Procedia Computer Science 196 (2022) 263–271\n",
      "4 \n",
      "Inês Araújo Machado et al. / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2021) 000–000 \n",
      "computational governance [1,4]. The first concept of the Data Mesh relates to the organization of the data in line with \n",
      "the business itself. When looking at the organizational structure, it is realized that, divisions are defined by areas of \n",
      "operation (e.g., logistics and customer support), also known as business domains [2]. The Data Mesh postulates the \n",
      "existence of a distributed responsibility, by the organization’s teams, that can better understand and produce the data \n",
      "of their specific business domain [21]. In this sense, the ingestion of data obeys the nature of data and decentralize \n",
      "ownership. Therefore, providing  the analytical data must always be aligned with the established domains [1]. To \n",
      "distribute responsibility and to decentralize the already known monolithic architectures, it is necessary to model the \n",
      "current data architecture based on the organization of analytical data by domains [4]. To better deal with change, \n",
      "domains will both store and serve their data [1]. The cost of discovering quality data is pointed out as one of the \n",
      "difficulties experienced in current monolithic data architectures (mainly Data Lake) [4]. Part of the problem comes \n",
      "from the fact that, even organizations that consider themselves data-oriented, do not treat the data with the proper \n",
      "democratization [21]. In this sense, the second concept of the Data Mesh emerges, being data as a product [1]. The \n",
      "Mesh applies the already known concept of \"Product Thinking\" to the data, so that it becomes the organization's top \n",
      "priority, and leaves data pipelining and storage concerns in the background [1]. A simple concept is applied here: \n",
      "analytical data is now seen as a product (and therefore its quality has to be ensured), and consumers of this data are \n",
      "now seen as customers, and their needs must be fulfilled [1]. This fact implies the existence of an infrastructure that \n",
      "allows the teams to produce and maintain their data products. For this, it is necessary that the teams have access to a \n",
      "high-level infrastructure, capable of encapsulating all the complexity inherent to it. Therefore, the third concept \n",
      "emerges - self-serve data platform - that empowers teams with the autonomy needed to manage their domains [1]. \n",
      "From domain to domain, there is a diverse set of technologies to meet the goals of each data product [1]. For the Data \n",
      "Mesh to work as expected, the notion of interoperability and connectivity must be present and well defined [4]. Thus, \n",
      "the self-serve platform must be able to provide the tools and interfaces necessary for the creation and maintenance of \n",
      "data products, without the need for highly specialized knowledge (such as the one that is currently seen in Data Lakes) \n",
      "[4]. Finally, there must be a mechanism that allows interoperability between different domains - the governance model \n",
      "(fourth concept). This governance model must be able to carry out an automated execution of decisions, as well as \n",
      "allow the decentralization and independence of each domain in the Mesh. For this, global normalization is necessary, \n",
      "which Zhamak Dehghani denominates as “federated computational governance” [4]. This concept aims to apply a set \n",
      "of rules to all interfaces of the various data products. The federated computational governance is a complex model, \n",
      "which does not reject change [4]. In general, and taking into account the above-mentioned concepts and key points, \n",
      "the main features that the Data Mesh provide are [4]: i) decentralized team composed of domain representatives, and \n",
      "a clear ownership and responsibility for each data product; ii) use of a self-serve platform to support the development \n",
      "of data products, maintaining the infrastructure and managing the Data Mesh itself; iii) definition of how to model the \n",
      "quality, requirements, and security of data; iv) dealing with the various technologies used in the data products, to \n",
      "ensure interoperability. \n",
      "3.2. Dehghani’s Approach for the Design and Implementation of a Data Mesh \n",
      "It is important to understand how domains arise and are organized. There are two types of domains: source and \n",
      "consumer domains [2]. Source domains consist of the producers of the data in its raw state at the creation point, not \n",
      "modeled for any consumer. Consumer domains are data domains that may or may not be aligned with source domains. \n",
      "They are different in nature from source domain data, as they undergo significant structural changes. The transformed \n",
      "data is often presented in aggregated views (derived from the source domains) and also include models that allow \n",
      "access to them [1]. Therefore, the data pipelines are made internally within each domain [2]. Each domain has to \n",
      "establish its service quality level, making available to its consumers the quality that its data holds, as well as its lineage, \n",
      "error rate, and schema [1]. Fig. 1 illustrates de concepts described above.  \n",

      "Data as a Product implies that there is a set of characteristics that are held by the data [21], since this concept \n",
      "intends to maximize the quality of data [4]. Zhamak Dehghani defends that there are six principles that must be \n",
      "fulfilled to maintain the data quality and efficiency of the Data Mesh [1]. Those principles (DATSIS principles) are \n",
      "the following [22]: Discoverable, Addressable, Trustworthy, Self-describing, Interoperable, and Secure. This \n",
      "orientation towards data as a product results in the appearance of new roles, such as domain data product owner and \n",
      "data product developer [1]. The domain data product owner is concerned with the satisfaction of the consumers of \n",
      "their data products and manage their lifecycle. Consequently, they are responsible for the decision-making around \n",
      "their data products. The domain data product owners must make their work measurable (making use of key \n",
      "performance indicators such as lead time for data availability) [1]. Data product developers are responsible for \n",
      "building, maintaining, and serving the data product domains [4]. Data product developers are not exclusive to a \n",
      "specific domain, and given the organizational needs, these teams can change between domains. When compared to \n",
      "current and past paradigms, the responsibility model is thus reversed, since the responsibility over the data is now \n",
      "close to the source [4]. Considering the definition of this concept, it is possible to define the architectural quantum \n",

      "access to the data and metadata, and the code used for access policies. The data within a data product can be from \n",
      "different types (e.g., batch files and events), but for it to be used, there must be an association between the data and \n",
      "the respective metadata. The infrastructure component  allows access to the data and metadata, as well as running the \n",
      "code related to the data product in question [4]. One of the major concerns with the self-serve data platform is the \n",
      "duplication of efforts in the setup of the pipeline engine by the domain teams [2]. To avoid this inefficient duplication \n",

      "there is a need to store, process and use significant amounts of data per day – to do so, the company used a Data Lake. \n",
      "With the use of this Data Lake, some challenges began to arise: the lack of ownership over the data, the poor quality \n",
      "of the data after its processing, and the organizational scalability (with the increasing number of data sources and \n",
      "consumers, the data team became a bottleneck) [23]. Faced with these difficulties, and as a way of trying to overcome \n",
      "them, Zalando decided to build its own Data Mesh. There were some relevant changes: i) evolution towards \n",
      "decentralized data ownership; ii) prioritization of data domains, in detriment of pipelines; iii) vision of data as a \n",
      "product and not as by-product; iv) institution of multifunctionality teams organized by domain; v) abandoning a \n",

      "(decentralizing this infrastructure responsibility to a data infrastructure as a platform) and migrate from a monolithic \n",
      "data architecture (the Data Lake) to an interoperable services environment (the Data Mesh) [23]. Fig. 4 shows the \n",
      "Data Mesh architecture implemented by Zalando. The initial central service (Data Lake Storage) was maintained and \n",

      "(and its productions) into one system, capable of dealing with this large volume of data in an integrated and sustainable \n",
      "way [24]. Therefore, at the beginning of this process, Netflix made a survey about the problems of data transportation \n",
      "that they felt in their scope. They found five major problems: i) duplication of efforts regarding the data pipelines and \n",

      "Over time, there has been an evolution of data architectures – for example, from Data Warehouses to Data Lakes. \n",
      "Naturally, and as explained in section 2 of this paper, each of these data architectures have been demonstrating their \n",
      "limitations (e.g., bottlenecks associated with having a central development team). It is within these limitations that the \n",
      "various evolutions have emerged until today. As far as Data Lakes are concerned, being these currently the most \n",
      "common type of data architectures adopted by companies [2], it was possible to infer that despite all the advantages \n",
      "associated with them (e.g., the possibility of a large data ingestion without worrying about rigid data schemes), they \n",
      "have not come to efficiently satisfy the needs of the organizations. Consequently, there is a problem that must be \n",
      "addressed. This work allowed perception that the Data Mesh is not just about inserting new technologies into existing \n",
      "architectures, or adding new capabilities, or reorganizing only their components. The Data Mesh brings with it the \n",
      "need to change the current paradigm since the platform's infrastructure itself to the reorganization of the data teams. \n",
      "The fact that organizations do not consider the nature of the data when ingested, raises the problem of the lack of \n",
      "ownership and understanding. Now, in an organization where data is needed and produced by the majority, but owned \n",
      "by no one in practice, there are, as highlighted in this work, problems of data quality - which end up affecting the \n",
      "potentiality of their analytical value. Therefore, the Data Mesh tries to solve this problem by making the data the real \n",
      "organizational concern. Taking this into consideration, it is possible to synthesize that the Data Mesh ensures \n",
      "compliance with DATSIS principles, turns data into a product, organizes the various teams and data products \n",

      "users, who can access it accordingly to the federated governance policy present in that node (e.g., node A can read the \n",

      "and ensure the quality of the data within the organization in their Data Mesh, as demonstrated by Zalando’s work [23]. \n",

      "Systems Management. Olivier and colleagues [7] presented the IoT Sensing Platform as a Driver for Digital Farming\n",

      "[10] on the security aspect of the Internet of Things in Water Management and Treatment is very relevant. Most of\n",
      "these works demonstrated the growing trends in using IoT and sensor devices in water management systems.\n",

      "Cloud environments in this paper.\n",
      "2.2. Data Mesh\n",
      "As defined by Zhamak Dehghani [1], a data mesh is a type of data platform architecture that embraces the ubiquity\n",
      "of data in the enterprise by leveraging a domain-oriented, self-serve design. It focuses on domain-driven design cor-\n",
      "responding business domain. Given that the paradigm has just been introduced recently, there are only a few works in\n",
      "data mesh.\n",
      "Strengholt’s book [13] on data management at scale discussed the paradigm in great detail with a strong use case\n",
      "for managing data at scale. Sahni et al. [9] work is also related to data mesh but in a more infrastructure layer.\n",
      "He introduced Edge Mesh which aims to provide many benefits, including distributed processing, low latency, fault\n",
      "tolerance, better scalability, better security, and privacy. Machado et al. [4] proposed a domain model and a conceptual\n",
      "architecture for the achievement of decentralized data architectures, which is based heavily on the data mesh concept.\n",
      "Machado et al. [5] also presented additional work on data mesh in 2022, focusing on the motivation for the appearance\n",
      "of the Data Mesh paradigm, its features, and approaches for its implementation.\n",
      "2.2.1. Data Mesh Principles\n",
      "Data Mesh builds on top of four principles given as follows.\n",
      "1. Domain-oriented, decentralized data ownership, and architecture, meaning that organizational/business functions\n",
      "need to own their data.\n",
      "2. Data as a product and to expose the domain’s products in a form that is usable to others.\n",
      "3. Data infrastructure as a platform that offers different capabilities in a self-service manner.\n",
      "4. Federated computational governance, balancing the act of having just enough centralized control to ease the work\n",
      "but keeping the decision-making as local as possible.\n",
      "2.2.2. Data Mesh Topology\n",
      "There are several approaches in designing a data mesh topology [13] as given in the figure below.\n",
      "1. Governed mesh topology allows the different data domains to be grouped and represented as nodes. Each node\n",
      "is a domain, which can represent itself as either a data provider and/or data consumer towards the other domains.\n",
      "2. Harmonized mesh topology allows nodes to operate more on their own. Data distribution goes point-to-point but\n",
      "is governed at the same time. The central data hub allows domains to operate their own platforms whilst adhering\n",
      "to common policies and standards.\n",

      "1. Domain-oriented, decentralized data ownership, and architecture, meaning that organizational/business functions\n",
      "need to own their data.\n",

      "2.2.2. Data Mesh Topology\n",
      "There are several approaches in designing a data mesh topology [13] as given in the figure below.\n",
      "1. Governed mesh topology allows the different data domains to be grouped and represented as nodes. Each node\n",
      "is a domain, which can represent itself as either a data provider and/or data consumer towards the other domains.\n",
      "2. Harmonized mesh topology allows nodes to operate more on their own. Data distribution goes point-to-point but\n",
      "is governed at the same time. The central data hub allows domains to operate their own platforms whilst adhering\n",
      "to common policies and standards.\n",

      "for data commercial usage can bring new solutions or \n",
      "services for citizens; data driven decision are always \n",
      "better justified and more conscious. \n",
      "• Consider delivering data products as an \n",

      "“company structure”. \n",
      " \n",
      "Motivation: It is crucial to evaluate who proposes the implementation of a data \n",
      "mesh and why. Because of the new distribution of responsibility to the business \n",
      "units, they must be fully aware of the effects a data mesh has on their workload. \n",
      "The work of the data engineering and IT departments becomes less stressful, and \n",
      "they can refocus on their intended assignments, creating a big incentive to \n",
      "implement a data mesh. That is why the motivation must be closely analyzed, if \n",
      "the idea of implementing a data mesh is brought forth by the IT department and \n",
      "not fully understood by the business units. \n",
      " \n",
      "IT history: A data mesh can be a very useful architecture, when the company has \n",
      "conducted many IT and data experiments leading to isolated systems, that \n",
      "otherwise cannot be connected to the main system or whose data cannot be \n",
      "accessed. \n",
      " \n",
      "Company culture: To support the successful implementation of a data mesh, it is \n",
      "important to make data a priority in the company and allow for flexible problem \n",
      "solving. Additionally, management must be willing to give up responsibilities to \n",
      "the self-governing independent teams and support them in their local decision-\n",
      "making. If this empowerment of the teams cannot be guaranteed by management, \n",
      "then a data mesh should not be implemented. \n",
      " \n",
      "IT structure: According to the experts’ opinions, a data mesh is especially useful \n",
      "in connecting isolated or legacy systems, clouds or data silos, which have a great \n",
      "amount of friction in data workflows and pipelines. \n",
      " \n",
      "Company structure: The data architecture should mimic the companies’ own \n",
      "structure: Geographically distributed companies or companies that are comprised \n",
      "of loosely coupled, independent business units can reap a greater benefit, because \n",
      "the domain boundaries can be easily derived. Consolidating these independent \n",
      "business units in a centralized solution would lead to more organizational \n",
      "overhead and problems. Additionally, the company size and amount of data \n",
      "should be considered, as small and mid-sized companies with a small amount of \n",

      "Theoretical and Practical Implications \n",
      "The compiled factors can be used to help companies in deciding whether a data mesh can \n",
      "solve the data engineering challenges and further the usage of data or whether the overhead \n",
      "of implementing a data mesh is too much in comparison to its benefits. If the data mesh is \n",
      "not feasible, the company might consider the mentioned alternatives to find a suitable data \n",
      "architecture solution. \n",
      "5.2 \n",
      "Limitations and Outlook \n",
      "Because the conversation about the data mesh has only started in 2019, not many \n",
      "implementation tools have been developed and distributed widely and the topic has not \n",
      "been fully academically discovered, many questions remain unanswered. Some companies \n",
      "report anecdotal successes and benefits due to the implementation of a data mesh, but an \n",
      "academic evaluation is still missing. To conclude, the conversation of moving away from \n",
      "monolithic data architectures might highlight the data usage within companies and bring \n",
      "on a new era of data integration. \n",

      "introducing us to steam power, electricity, and automated production, we are trans-\n",
      "forming to the next industrial revolution: The fourth industrial revolution. This fourth \n",
      "revolution is the digital revolution that has been occurring since the middle of the last \n",

      "For the past few years, big data has been one of the most exciting and refreshing stim-\n",
      "ulating trends in the data engineering world. Big data has made enterprises develop \n",
      "their data strategies and projects to more complex levels. Almost every business has \n",
      "data to benefit from, which is why data engineering and information management are \n",
      "becoming a larger part of a successful business. However, for some companies’ data \n",
      "are still an unclear object they are trying to tackle. Therefore, efficient data architecture \n",
      "is required for enterprises to achieve the full potential from the data they own. \n",
      "Artificial intelligence (AI) is all around us, and we are already experiencing drones \n",
      "and self-driving cars with digital assistants and software that helps us in our daily tasks. \n",
      "Impressive progress has been made in AI research in recent years. The rapid growth \n",
