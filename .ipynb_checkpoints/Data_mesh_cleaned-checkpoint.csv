facilitate composability describe extension let u first illustrate deem concept port important actual implementation fig show small example consisting three product illustrated dashed boundary even greenfield setup processing system part instead source system represented called source aligned product source aligned product often one input port consume original source system exhibit several output port rationale behind providing several output port provided different format made available different interface example product present useful abstraction original source provide streaming fashion via apache kafka topic distributed blob storage fashion via aws bucket product still manifest abstraction source make sense abstraction encapsulated one product two output port two separate product another category product called consumer aligned product whereas source aligned product provide rather general way multiple format order support many potential consumption use case consumer aligned product focused one specific consumption use case optimizes value consumer aligned product often combine different source aligned product meaningful way consumer aligned product therefore often several input port one output port specific consumption use case mind previously described customer recommendation product consumer aligned product read upstream customer tracking information

ideally lead faster business value reduction duplicate effort primary goal platform allow scaling decentralized creation product across organization avoiding duplication infrastructure effort thereby reducing need infrastructure skill every product team thus main objective platform make product creation maintenance easy possible purpose product developer experience plane mentioned sect important objective platform provide set centralized service needed enable desired network effect product composition purpose often called experience plane important service provided plane central product catalog allows user search existing product creation management global standard policy aspect plane make sure organization following standard policy platform need able enforce standardization various level time platform also need provide flexibility common scenario large organization team need embed existing business process product challenging platform support customization service platform therefore allow product team extend existing feature long respect contract offered platform focus distributing responsibility managing complexity across multiple team within organization stand contrast traditional approach force centralization control complexity decentralization however creates risk forming silo creating incompatibility produced different team typical challenge thus right balance two contrasting idea federated decentralization common standardization process balancing decentralization standardization one hand platform need enable decentralized team way build evolve product without check back central authority decentralization allows team act independently key ability scale hand platform also play role standard promoting mechanism counteracts heterogenization stem team independence however standardization enforced top fashion instead support convenience tool provided platform easy use help team achieve goal efficiently tool used convenience tool usage

art latform discussed general structure requirement platform let look specific requirement federated governance affect platform design governance general field activity aim ensure trustworthiness minimize related risk example activity security audit definition company wide quality standard overall governance encompasses broad variety topic quality visbility ownership consistency security access control compliance first topic tackled however usually access control fourth principle federated computational governance describes decentralized approach governance enabled automation provided platform therefore focus governance achieve decentralized access control decentralized access control mean decentralized team responsible product one decide consume product stand stark contrast typical situation instance protection officer team fulfill task central position usually argued necessary decentralizable liability legal issue platform therefore need provide mean distribute individual access decision team time allow central function protection officer prescribe enforce review global access control policy example could following access critical financial information granted people listed insider country financial trading supervision authority example global policy put place central function individual access request however handled requested product team mean platform enable team make decision locally making sure global policy adhered disallowing access grant person service whose role sufficiently specified furthermore platform provide mean tag classified critical financial information tagging however done decentralized respective team see next section platform requirement decentralized governance section discus platform support interplay global policy decentralized decision making described order infer use case platform need support present slightly involved example governance challenge decentralized setup let imagine source aligned product dp serving web tracking company user contains personal identifiable information pii therefore considered highly sensitive first two activity around governance platform support following first need way protection expert define global sensitivity level well policy level need handled order stay compliant government regulation protect right customer example three sensitivity level policy could financial mean access need restricted person insider list highly sensitive mean need always stored encrypted sensitive pii case encrypted need exhibit traceable reference affected person order able delete specific person case person file deletion request according eu general protection regulation gdpr right forgotten second decentralized team responsible source aligned product provided tool easily tag applying globally defined sensitivity level tagging functionality provided way platform automate implementation least check fulfillment policy associated respective sensitivity level way avoid central governance team becomes bottleneck busy trying understand detail product one way forcing team least use global sensitivity level refuse processing tagged shared infrastructure platform providing product composition discussed sect ii connected decentralized governance decentralized governance scale every product team consuming another product decide sensitive consumed would require intricate knowledge consumed instead sensitivity tag carried transitively along higher order product composition actively supported platform let stick example source aligned product dp serf pii containing team using global sensitivity level tag accordingly mean output port product serving consequently state pii sensitive another product dp consumes via one input port output port dp marked pii sensitive default platform support mean new composed product created using platform tool transitive tagging output port happen automatically one tool bakes principle metadata propagation lineage apache atlas one reason chose use part reference platform implementation course team responsible dp hindered autonomy need enabled make local decision applying expertise example one output port serving cleansed pii team able override automatically assigned sensitivity level vice versa product consuming non sensitive combining way becomes sensitive way sale allows revenue forecast team also need able override automatically assigned sensitivity level fig illustrates interplay global policy localized decision platform support fig interplay global policy localized decision platform support example sensitivity level order render central governance ineffective everyone simply override sensitivity tag override higher order product need reviewed approved central governance course entail risk central governance becoming bottleneck therefore approval process need automated much possible instance override applies sensitivity level strict one input could approved automatically similarly product level many access request possible handled automatically role based authorization rbac product team need specify kind serve actual authorization governed global role based policy informed local knowledge implementation approach discussing mean access control three popular contending approach implement general idea computational governance mean central authority upon getting request decides whether grant deny access executing automated rule meta property consumer request may granted execution single rule collective context many different rule access control list acl example consider scenario product two product marketing global default rule platform deny access request however specific access rule defined marketing allows product within marketing access output port scenario product access product since specific acl override global policy fig managing policy using open policy agent policy engine fig present simplified version approach policy management reference platform implementation using open policy agent opa policy engine used policy authoring well policy enforcement provides high level declarative language used specify policy code seen rule may applied overridden let dive deeper method execution different approach available gateway approach one commonly implemented approach central governing gateway server process incoming request act centralized query access server similar typical oltp transaction processing access authorization pattern governance steward product developer describe rbac policy specific datasets schema enforced client user connects via credential often system user authenticates via jdbc gateway server may may process result case tool separate storage compute spark presto impala authorization gateway act jdbc proxy par query check credential session valid forward request massively parallel processing tool largely process hand back result advantage approach work seamlessly client since jdbc based authorization around long time also approach illustrated fig offer powerful attribute based access control column level however may fail scale large datasets large number customer frequent system query also mostly work relational database datasets fig gateway approach central access server example presto rbac oltp token approach another approach gaining popularity token generator proxy server leveraging power decoupled compute storage processing system like apache spark approach provides added benefit scaling per client without becoming bottleneck proxy access server instead providing directly authorizes incoming request datasets fetch meta information catalog case source query successfully pass check return token underlying system well information authenticate directly underlying storage illustrate approach fig system scale well also work non relational datasets like image blob etc downside may work well storage type need custom implementation underlying storage databricks delta sharing example framework based approach fig token approach example apache ranger privacera encryption rest approach pattern authorization enforcement encrypted rest producer using encryption key central key management server km hand decryption key client lot tool making use approach additional compute time spent encrypting decrypting many time however big advantage approach illustrate fig additional security brings even system copy source system need key well compute decrypt stored format like parquet good storage format encryption scheme example dealing personal health information form sensitive health personal often matter compliance approach like homomorphic encryption important provide identity preserving way processing fig encryption rest approach requires custom tooling another alternative three approach would like mention access server upon creation policy translates map policy underlying compute bucket policy database role restriction apache ranger plugins cloud based storage commonly use approach enforce authorization natively cloud resource important part making approach work practice ensure enough frictionless abstraction exist user never need know underlying access granted current technology landscape single tool cover aspect required implementing federated computational governance experience combination existing tool standard employing hybrid approach need applied top abstraction need created user ecosystem use easily example gateway server approach work well beginning system exist replaced token based approach large frequently queried datasets

approach consequently important keep mind organizational cultural change difficult part need considered company strategy rq current challenge related projec t organization currently could help expert view current challenge related project chapter answer research current challenge related project investigated three different perspective common challenge related project mistake organization often make invest related project challenge organization face term management utilization interview revealed multiple challenge related project two challenge mentioned time interview revealed two main challenge related project lack skill resource unclear scope goal found scope goal ofte poorly defined beginning project consequently clarity regarding necessary availability intended user purpose often remains vague turn often lead endless project ultimately mean higher cost co ncerning skill resource interviewee recognized either difficult get right people involved project understanding available utilize poor level many organization lack technical ex perience result technical competence often centralized taking responsibility technology also clear industry technology oriented many year current trend strongly foc used tool technology consequently many organization tend go technology first mindset invest related project also clear many project planned sufficient high enough level decision kers often understand needed bigger picture lack understanding needed available need needed come challenge term management uti lization cultural factor common challenge especially lack culture often seen way shared enough organization meaning easily comprehensibly available often larger organization siloed within different business unit shared unit distinct business goal stem lack driven culture turn organization business strategy many element within organization interlinked influence one another often challenge related skill resource organization also top management culture strategy objective defined articulated organization solving challenge easy organization want reach point promotes driven culture business mean everyone organization understands meaning take responsibility understands utilization actively participates continuous improvement turn happens culture turn derived strategy strategy turn set top management help solve current challenge ata project based interview concluded solve primary challenge project lack skill resource unclear scope objective type challenge me try solve nevertheless interviewee like approach several interviewee hope future organization would pay attention ownership responsibility product thinking platform thinking self service ca pabilities well governance aspect try promote however many believe adopting approach currently significant leap organization given high level maturity competence resource emands although solve primary challenge project may help organization improve quality moving ownership responsibility closer work closely applying produ ct thinking may help transforming unmaintained unused datasets valuable asset designated stakeholder clear purpose applying platform thinking self serve capability may help bring accessible closer user thi turn may simplify improve process ultimately increase trust federated governance hand help organization create working cooperation model clarify role responsibility increase value reduce related cost risk conclusion main objective find describe needed implement organization objective achieved reviewing literature history enterprise architecture analyzing case company user story implementation including technology used motivation implementation well perspective technology provider current architecture technology focused primarily organization approach organization think manage large scale addition although creation culture seen even important technology right technology platform needed different area organiz ation follow
